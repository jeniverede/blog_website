              As everyone knows, clothes make the man. But as is shown by the
              permanent exhibition in the Dresden Residenzschloss (Royal
              Palace), which opened in the spring of 2017, clothes also make
              politics. The so-called landscape costume of Saxon Elector John
              George I (1585–1656), for example, is embroidered with the Elbe
              landscape near Dresden and Meißen and shows farming activities,
              people and animals, as well as the Dresden Residenzschloss. It was
              a Christmas gift given by the electoral widow Sophie (1568–1622)
              when her son assumed power after the sudden death of his brother
              Christian II in 1611. Wearing the coat, the new ruler now had the
              electorate that had been entrusted to him on his body and stood,
              quite literally, at the centre of it all.
            </p>

            <p>
              A total of twenty-seven rulers’ costumes are presented in the four
              exhibition halls, where they unfurl their sensual splendour, from
              their different materials to embroidery, decoration, lace and
              trimmings of gold, silver and silk. For seventy-five years, the
              clothing was no longer on show as a whole. In the twenty years
              leading up to the reopening, more than forty textile and metal
              conservators, scientists, museologists, photographers, costume
              designers and other specialists made sure that the haute couture
              of 1550–1650 would appear in renewed magnificence. In order to
              protect the sensitive fabrics from too much light, the costumes
              will be shown in rotation. Six complete ensembles, eleven suits
              with doublet and trousers, six robes and four ladies’ gowns: In
              the international museum landscape there is hardly anything
              comparable from this time period.
            </p>

            <p>
              The Dresden pieces are crucial to an understanding of the European
              fashion and textile art of the Renaissance and early Baroque
              periods. Ladies’ dresses in particular were seldom preserved;
              instead they were repurposed or given away. For this reason, the
              magnificent gown of Magdalene Sibylle of Prussia, Electress of
              Saxony, is a rare treasure from the time around 1610–1620, all the
              more so as the princess was a connoisseur of fashion, as is seen
              in the clear connections between her wardrobe and Venetian bridal
              and ceremonial fashion.

            <p>
              The costume collection comprises of approximately 4.000 items:
              men’s-, women’s- and children’s clothes from 1700 to the middle of
              the 20th century. In addition the Rijksmuseum also holds several
              costumes from the 17th century worn by important historical
              figures. However the emphasis of the costume collection lies on
              the 18th century with a wedding dress of c. 1760 with a two metres
              wide skirt as the ultimate highlight. The 19th and 20th centuries
              are well represented with examples from fashion houses at home and
              abroad. Of a more recent date are the post-war dress made of silk
              maps and the Yves Saint Laurent ‘Mondrian’ dress from 1965.

            <p>
              Although most of the costumes from the collection have been worn
              by Dutch men and women, the fabrics, cut or embellishments often
              came from abroad i.e. Paris, London, Rome, the Indian Coromandel
              coast or Canton in China. One of these exotic status symbols was
              the ‘Japonsche rock’, a kimono like banyan worn here since the
              17th century and of which the Rijksmuseum own various splendid
              examples.
